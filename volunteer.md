## Volunteering and Event Supervisor Information

We need lots of volunteers for our tournament on _January 25th, 2025_! If you are a Columbia student or non-Columbia Science Olympiad alum in the area interested in helping out, the volunteer signup form will be coming soon!

Roles include helping grade tests + judge events, helping supervisors run events (e.g. timing plane flights, setting up lab supplies, checking students in, etc.), and guiding students around campus.

The tournament will run for the entire day (6:00 A.M. to 9:00 P.M.), but there are options for early morning, morning, midday or afternoon shifts! We will also provide free breakfast and lunch to all volunteers.
