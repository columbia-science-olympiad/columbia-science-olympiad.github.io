## Volunteering and Event Supervisor Information

If you haven’t seen the announcement from earlier this week, CUSO is once again accepting applications for Event Supervisors for our annual tournament!! I wanted to especially encourage you all to Event Supervise at our tournament this year. Whether you were an ES or a volunteer last year, it wouldn’t have been possible for us to run such a successful tournament without your amazing tests and contributions. We would love to have you join us again this year!

&nbsp;

The link to apply is [here](https://forms.gle/3qBt9qefGHnDE78E6)

&nbsp;

Applications are due by September 25 (EOD today - don’t worry, it’s not too long!). Definitely leave an extra note in the application to tell us if you were an ES last year (and for which events).
