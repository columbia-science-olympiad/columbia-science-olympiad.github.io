  Registration opens October 21, 2022 and will close November 21, 2022. We are
  accepting 30 teams for our competition this year, and the registration fee is
  $150 per team (if this fee is a barrier to your registration, please reach out
  and we will do our best to accommodate you). A maximum of two teams per school
  will be accepted initially, but if space remains after registration closes, we
  may reopen registration for a third team for schools who are interested.
