We are excited to announce that the first annual Division C Columbia University Science Olympiad Invitational Tournament will be hosted on Saturday, January 28, 2023! The tournament will be held in-person on Columbia Universityâ€™s Morningside Campus.

Registration opens October 21, 2022 and will close November 21, 2022. We are accepting 30 teams for our competition this year, and the registration fee is $150 per team (if this fee is a barrier to your registration, please reach out and we will do our best to accommodate you). A maximum of two teams per school will be accepted initially, but if space remains after registration closes, we may reopen registration for a third team for schools who are interested.

Registration will be open on October 21, 2022 at 4:00PM ET [here](https://forms.gle/SHVvPxHeLXF3G13S6). Please contact <columbiascienceolympiad@gmail.com> if you have any questions!
